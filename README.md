# Map Number

An online address book that converts one's address to simple string of integers.

The finished project can be found at https://darryltanzil.sown.io/mapnumber.

This simple web application uses PHP and MySQL for the back-end, and regular HTML5 for front-end; users register a "map number"
which can then be looked up in the future. 

This was developed around 2017, and I did it with intentions to learn about PHP's communication with databases- I learned a lot about MySQLi, and the importance of encrypting
information before storing them in databases.
